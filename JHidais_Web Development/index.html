        <p>The whole objective of the game is to do activies by yourself or with some friends and get stronger from them to eventually hit what is called "end game". Once you hit the end game you and your team that you assembled will go and try to defeat raid bosses and other forms of end game activies to attain better gear on your quest for strength.</p>
