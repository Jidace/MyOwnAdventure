        <p> As a hunter you have access to a range of roles between your three subclasses such as support, damage, ad clearing etc. As a hunter your movement is really slippery between your double to triple jumps,roll evade, and invisibility you are a hassle to keep track of. </p>

        <p> As a hunter you swear to your cloak/cape and you are mentored by cayde-6, a charismatic exo (robot who used to be human) who is undoubtly the best of the three mentors. Cayde is a goof ball but when it comes down to it he always gets the job done. </p>
